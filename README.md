# ICP Blockchain Compound Interest Project

## Introduction

Welcome to the ICP Blockchain Compound Interest Project! This project is a simple educational demonstration of compound interest using the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) blockchain.

### Features

- **Compound Interest Simulation**: This project simulates compound interest to help users understand the concept and its potential benefits.

- **Educational Purpose**: It's designed for educational purposes and does not involve real funds or ICP tokens.

- **User-Friendly Interface**: We've created a user-friendly web interface that makes it easy to track your investments and earnings.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone or Download**: Clone or download this project to your local machine.

2. **Open the Web Interface**: Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to start exploring the compound interest simulation.

## Project Structure

### 1. `src/` - Canister Source

- The `src/` directory located at the root of the project contains the source code for your canister smart contracts. This is where you write your Motoko or Rust code to define the functionality of your canisters.

### 2. `src/` - Frontend Source

- The second `src/` directory is typically located within a subdirectory, often called something like `src/frontend`. It houses the source code for the frontend application that interacts with your canisters.

- `assets/`: You can store static assets, such as HTML, CSS, or JavaScript files here.

- `dfx.json`: The DFX configuration file where you configure your project settings.

- `README.md`: You're currently reading it!
